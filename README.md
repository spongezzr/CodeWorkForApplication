# CodeWorkForApplication

In this repository, you can find the algorithms that I worked on during Data Science Certification program when I was in UCLA Extension. I applied many of them to my work, including Machine Learning with Pandas and R, data visualization with Python and Tableau, etc. However, since the projects in work are highly confidential, I don't have the access to them.
